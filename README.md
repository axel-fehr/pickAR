PickAR

_What is PickAR?_
PickAR provides a way for architects and craftsmen to visually compare different materials they can choose to build a wall or a ceiling. It is an application for Microsoftâ€™s Hololens, where one can choose from a list of materials in mixed reality, drag tiles of these materials onto surfaces in the real world (e.g. walls or ceilings) and simply releasing them there.

_What problem does it solve?_
One can choose among countless materials to design a wall or a ceiling. Even after filtering for materials that have the required physical properties (e.g. sound attenuation or heat resistance), one is often still faced with many choices. PickAR provides a quick, easy-to-use and intuitive interface based on mixed reality to select materials from a list and visualize what a wall or ceiling would look like if it were actually made of the selected material. This visual comparison makes it easier for architects and craftsmen to select materials that suit their needs best.
